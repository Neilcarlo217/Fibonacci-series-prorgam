# Fibonacci-series-prorgam

In this program we find series of fibonacci numbers.
Fibonacci numbes are 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 ....so on
First two numbers are 0 and 1
next if you add 0+1=1,therefore third number is also 1
next will be 1+1=2,so the fourth number will be 2
next will be 1+2=3,so the fifth number will be 3
next will be 2+3=2,so the sixth number will be 5
and so on

#In this code first we will create a fib method so that we can call it n number of times
Here we check if the number is zero or one if it is the pront the same ,
next for finding third fib number we will use the older values like fib(2-2)+fib(2+1) ie.fib(0)=0,fib(1)=1 therefore fib(2)=0+1=1
and so on.

#next we create the main method where we ask the number of fibonacci series to print and next we print the fibonacci series.

#To execute in command prompt
1.go to the folder where its stored 
2.complie the code using  'javac FibonacciProgram. java'
3.run using 'java FibonacciProgram'


#you can execute in eclipse or any other comiler which is available.
